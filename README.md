<p>Azure resourcegroup remover has a few basic functions (use at own risk):</p>
<ul>
<li>List all resource group in your subscription</li>
<li>Select resource group to delete</li>
<li>Delete all resource group in your subsctiption</li>
</ul>
<p>To run:</p>
<p>Please make sure you have Azure Powershell installed and are logged into the subscription you would like to run this script against.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Script was made to remove the repetative task of using the azure UI to remove unwanted resoruce groups one by one, i believe removing resource groups in bulk via UI is currently not available, hence providing you with an option to remove all in one go.</p>
